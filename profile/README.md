AlgorithmicDynamics hosts open-source projects exploring computational and algorithmic dynamical systems.

Projects include fractal generation, symbolic billiards, cellular automata, genetic evolution, and related computational models.

Repositories in this organization focus on reference implementations, experiments, and research-oriented explorations of discrete and algorithmic dynamics.
